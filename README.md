# Diabetes-Mellitus-Prediction
The primary objective of Diabetes Mellitus Prediction is to identify individuals who
have a higher probability of developing diabetes in the future. By leveraging predictive
modeling techniques, healthcare professionals can identify at-risk individuals at an early
stage, allowing for targeted interventions, preventive measures, and personalized treatment
plans. Early detection and timely intervention can significantly reduce the risk of
complications associated with Diabetes, such as cardiovascular diseases, kidney problems,
and nerve damage.
